I"T<p>I’m Mattia! Born in Venice, and grownup as a European. Untiring traveler, lifelong learner, passionate about science, technology, and photography. I enjoy my days’ coding, going out in the wild nature to take photos and if snow involved, having fun with my board.

Accomplished full-stack developer focused on complex web-based applications, PWA, and hybrid mobile applications. Long-term experience developing a wide range of solutions, I worked with several technologies in different industries and markets keeping the focus on a great product and end-user experiences within mind cost efficiency and scalability.
